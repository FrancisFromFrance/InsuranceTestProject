# InsuranceTestProject
Making a sample insurance calculator and writing test cases for each class helped improve my understanding of testing and agile programming. I learned the importance of 
writing tests before implementing the code, which allowed me to catch bugs and errors early in the development process. I also gained experience in using a testing 
framework and the different types of tests. This project was about testing not functionality.
